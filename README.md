# Next.js 15 - Link Component Issue with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `Link` component from `next/link` in Next.js 15 when used with dynamic routes.  The issue can manifest in unexpected behavior such as 404 errors or incorrect page rendering.

## Problem Description

The `Link` component may not function as expected when used in conjunction with dynamic segments or nested routes. This can result in broken links or incorrect routing. The exact cause depends on the context and setup. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the home page. Note that the link to the about page works correctly.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect route definition:**  Ensure the routes in your `pages` directory are correctly structured and match the URLs in your `Link` components.
* **Conflicting router configurations:** Check for any conflicting router configurations or middleware that might interfere with the `Link` component's functionality.
* **Missing or incorrect `next/link` import:** Double-check that you are importing the `Link` component correctly from `next/link`.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) issues:** If the route is only generated on the server, you may need to handle that case differently

## Potential Solutions

* **Verify Route Definitions:** Review the file structure and ensure that the routes in `pages` directory accurately match the `href` properties of the `Link` components.
* **Use `router.push` (Client-Side):**  If using the link in a client-side context, you may consider using `router.push` from `next/router` to programmatically navigate.
* **Check for Middleware Conflicts:**  Investigate any custom middleware or conflicting configurations affecting the routing process.
* **Handle SSR and Client Side Routing:**  Ensure that your links are handled correctly in both SSR and Client-side rendering contexts

## Additional Information

The issue might be specific to particular configurations, such as using API routes or custom server setup. Providing context on the full environment can assist in debugging the issue effectively.
